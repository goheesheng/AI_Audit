If the gas usage of a transaction exceeds this limit, the transaction will fail. However, along with this benefit comes a side effect which is important to understand.\\n\\n### Unbounded Operations\\n\\nAn example in which the block gas limit can be an issue is in executing logic in an unbounded loop. Even without any malicious intent, this can easily go wrong. Just by e.g., having too large an array of users to send funds to can exceed the gas limit and prevent the transaction from ever succeeding, potentially permanently locking up funds.', lookup_str='', metadata={'source': 'docs_kandenzipefel\\\\vulnerabilities\\\\dos-gas-limit.md'}, lookup_index=0), Document(page_content=\"This situation can also lead to an attack. Say a bad actor decides to create a significant amount of addresses, with each address being paid a small amount of funds from the smart contract.

To do this, separate each payment into it's own transaction, and have the recipient call the function.\\n\\nIf, for some reason, you really need to loop through an array of unspecified length, at least expect it to potentially take multiple blocks, and allow it to be performed in multiple transactions - as seen in this example:\\n\\n```\\nstruct Payee {\\n    address addr;\\n    uint256 value;\\n}\\n\\nPayee[] payees;\\nuint256 nextPayeeIndex;\", lookup_str='', metadata={'source': 'docs_kandenzipefel\\\\vulnerabilities\\\\dos-gas-limit.md'}, lookup_index=0), Document(page_content=\"function payOut() {\\n    uint256 i = nextPayeeIndex;\\n    while (i < payees.length && msg.gas > 200000) {\\n      payees[i].addr.send(payees[i].value);\\n      i++;\\n    }\\n    nextPayeeIndex = i;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Block Stuffing\\n\\nIn some situations, your contract can be attacked with a block gas limit even if you don't loop through an array of unspecified length. An attacker can fill several blocks before a transaction can be processed by using a sufficiently high gas price.\\n\\nThis attack is done by issuing several transactions at a very high gas price.

An attacker bought a key then stuffed the next 13 blocks in a row so they could win the jackpot.\\n\\nTo prevent such attacks from occuring, it's important to carefully consider whether it's safe to incorporate time-based actions in your application.\\n\\nExample from: https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/attacks/denial-of-service/\\n\\n### Sources\\n\\n- https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/attacks/denial-of-service/\\n- https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Design-Rationale#gas-and-fees\", lookup_str='', metadata={'source': 'docs_kandenzipefel\\\\vulnerabilities\\\\dos-gas-limit.md'}, lookup_index=0), Document(page_content=\"## DoS with (Unexpected) revert\\n\\nA DoS (Denial of Service) may be caused when logic is unable to be executed as a result of an unexpected revert. This can happen for a number of reasons and it's important to consider all the ways in which your logic may revert. The examples listed below are *non-exhaustive*.\\n\\n### Reverting funds transfer\\n\\nDoS (Denial of Service) attacks can occur in functions when you try to send funds to a user and the functionality relies on that fund transfer being successful. \\n\\nThis can be problematic in the case that the funds are sent to a smart contract created by a bad actor, since they can simply create a fallback function that reverts all payments. \\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n```\\n// INSECURE\\ncontract Auction {\\n    address currentLeader;\\n    uint highestBid;\\n\\n    function bid() payable {\\n        require(msg.value > highestBid);\\n\\n        require(currentLeader.send(highestBid)); // Refund the old leader, if it fails then revert\", lookup_str='', metadata={'source': 'docs_kandenzipefel\\\\vulnerabilities\\\\dos-revert.md'}, lookup_index=0), Document(page_content='currentLeader = msg.sender;\\n        highestBid = msg.value;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAs you can see in this example, if an attacker bids from a smart contract with a fallback function reverting all payments, they can never be refunded, and thus no one can ever make a higher bid.\\n\\nThis can also be problematic without an attacker present. For example, you may want to pay an array of users by iterating through the array, and of course you would want to make sure each user is properly paid. The problem here is that if one payment fails, the funtion is reverted and no one is paid. \\n\\n```\\naddress[] private refundAddresses;\\nmapping (address => uint) public refunds;\\n\\n// bad\\nfunction refundAll() public {\\n    for(uint x; x < refundAddresses.length; x++) { // arbitrary length iteration based on how many addresses participated\\n        require(refundAddresses[x].send(refunds[refundAddresses[x]])) // doubly bad, now a single failure on send will hold up all funds\\n    }\\n}\\n```', lookup_str='', metadata={'source': 'docs_kandenzipefel\\\\vulnerabilities\\\\dos-revert.md'}, lookup_index=0), Document(page_content='An effective solution to this problem would be to use a pull payment system over the above push payment system.

One example of a system which is vulnerable to signature malleability is one in which validation as to whether an action can be executed is determined based on whether the signature has been previously used.\\n\\n```\\n// UNSECURE\\nrequire(!signatureUsed[signature]);\\n\\n// Validate signer and perform state modifying logic\\n...\\n\\nsignatureUsed[signature] = true;\\n```\\n\\nIn the above example, we can see that the `signature` is saved in a `signatureUsed` mapping after execution and validated to not exist in that mapping before execution. The problem with this is that if the `signature` can be modified while maintaining valididty, the transaction can be repeated by an attacker.\\n\\n### How it works\", lookup_str='', metadata={'source': 'docs_kandenzipefel\\\\vulnerabilities\\\\signature-malleability.md'}, lookup_index=0), Document(page_content=\"To understand how signature malleability works, we first need to understand a bit about elliptic curve cryptography. \\n\\nAn elliptic curve consists of all the points that satisfy an equation of the form:\\n\\n$y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$\\n\\nwhere\\n\\n$4a^3 + 27b^2 \\\\not= 0$ (to avoid singular points)\\n\\nSome examples:\\n\\n![Elliptic Curves](./img/elliptic-curves.png)\\n\\nNote that the curves are always symmetrical about the x-axis\\n\\nThe curve used by Ethereum is secp256k1, which looks like:\\n\\n![secp256k1](./img/secp256k1.png)\\n\\nNow that we understand the basics of elliptic curve cryptography, we can dig into how signature malleability actually works on Ethereum. \\n\\nEthereum uses [ECDSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm) as it's signature scheme.

       "  The vulnerability in this code is that the `withdrawReward()` function can be re-entered before the state is updated, allowing an attacker to withdraw the same reward multiple times. An attacker can do this by calling the `getFirstWithdrawalBonus()` function multiple times before the state is updated. \n",

       "  The vulnerability in this code is that it's susceptible to a reentrancy attack. An attacker can create a contract with a fallback function that calls `getFirstWithdrawalBonus()`, and then calls `withdrawReward()` before the balance is set to zero in `withdrawReward()`, allowing the attacker to repeatedly drain the contract's balance. \n",
