Specifically, it is of the form: `address = sha3(rlp.encode([account_address,transaction_nonce]))` (see [Keyless Ether](#keyless-eth) for some fun use cases of this).

Recalling that we preserve the state of the contract, it may seem that this function would allow you to change the state of the `start` variable in the local `FibonnacciBalance` contract. If so, this would allow one to withdraw more ether, as the resulting `calculatedFibNumber` is dependent on the `start` variable (as seen in the library contract).

Here I will only highlight some potentially less-obvious Blockchain nuanced Solidity coding patterns that can lead to attackers performing DOS attacks.\\n\\n**1. External calls without gas stipends** - It may be the case that you wish\\nto make an external call to an unknown contract and continue processing the\\ntransaction regardless whether that call fails or not. Typically this is\\nachieved by using the `CALL` opcode, which does not revert the transaction\\nif the call fails (see [Unchecked CALL Return Values](#unchecked-calls) for further details and examples).\\nLet us consider a simple example, where we have a contract wallet, that slowly\\ntrickles out ether when the `withdraw()` function is called. A `partner` can\\nadd their address and spend gas to call the withdraw, giving both the\\n`partner` and the `owner` 1% of the total contract balance.\\n\\n```solidity\\ncontract TrickleWallet {', lookup_str='', metadata={'source': 'docs_sigp_solidity_security_blog\\\\README.md'}, lookup_index=0), Document(page_content=\"address public partner; // withdrawal partner - pay the gas, split the withdraw\\n    address public constant owner = 0xA9E;\\n    uint timeLastWithdrawn;\\n    mapping(address => uint) withdrawPartnerBalances; // keep track of partners balances\\n\\n    function setWithdrawPartner(address _partner) public {\\n        require(partner == '0x0' || msg.sender == partner);\\n        partner = _partner;\\n    }\\n\\n    // withdraw 1% to recipient and 1% to owner\\n    function withdraw() public {\\n        uint amountToSend = address(this).balance/100;\\n        // perform a call without checking return\\n        // the recipient can revert, the owner will still get their share\\n        partner.call.value(amountToSend)();\\n        owner.transfer(amountToSend);\\n        // keep track of last withdrawal time\\n        timeLastWithdrawn = now;\\n        withdrawPartnerBalances[partner] += amountToSend;\\n    }\\n\\n    // allow deposit of funds\\n    function() payable {}\", lookup_str='', metadata={'source': 'docs_sigp_solidity_security_blog\\\\README.md'}, lookup_index=0), Document(page_content='// convenience function\\n    function contractBalance() view returns (uint) {\\n        return address(this).balance;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNotice that on line \\\\[17\\\\] we perform an external call sending 1% of the\\ncontract balance  to a user-specified account. The reason the `CALL` opcode is used, is to ensure that\\nthe owner still gets paid, even if the external call reverts. The issue is that\\nthe transaction will send all of its gas (in reality, only most of the transaction gas is sent, some is left to finish processing the call) to the external call. If the user were malicious they could create a contract that would consume all the gas, and force all transactions to `withdraw()` to fail, due to running out of gas.', lookup_str='', metadata={'source': 'docs_sigp_solidity_security_blog\\\\README.md'}, lookup_index=0), Document(page_content=\"For example, consider the following malicious contract that consumes all gas,\\n```solidity\\ncontract ConsumeAllGas {\\n    function () payable {\\n        // an assert consumes all transaction gas, unlike a\\n        //revert which returns the remaining gas\\n        assert(1==2);\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\nIf a withdrawal partner decided they didn't like the owner of the contract.\\nThey could set the partner address to this contract and lock all the funds in\\nthe `TrickleWallet` contract forever.\\n\\nTo prevent such DOS attack vectors, ensure a gas stipend is specified in an\\nexternal call, to limit the amount of gas that that transaction can use. In our\\nexample, we could remedy this attack by changing line \\\\[17\\\\] to:\\n```solidity\\npartner.call.gas(50000).value(amountToSend)();\\n```\\nThis modification allows only 50,000 gas to be spent on the external\\ntransaction.

Looping through externally manipulated mappings or arrays** - In my adventures I've seen various forms of this kind of pattern. Typically it appears in scenarios where an `owner` wishes to distribute tokens amongst their investors, and do so with a `distribute()`-like function as can be seen in the example contract:\\n\\n```solidity\\ncontract DistributeTokens {\\n    address public owner; // gets set somewhere\\n    address[] investors; // array of investors\\n    uint[] investorTokens; // the amount of tokens each investor gets\\n\\n    // ... extra functionality, including transfertoken()\\n\\n    function invest() public payable {\\n        investors.push(msg.sender);\\n        investorTokens.push(msg.value * 5); // 5 times the wei sent\\n        }\", lookup_str='', metadata={'source': 'docs_sigp_solidity_security_blog\\\\README.md'}, lookup_index=0), Document(page_content='function distribute() public {\\n        require(msg.sender == owner); // only owner\\n        for(uint i = 0; i < investors.length; i++) {\\n            // here transferToken(to,amount) transfers \"amount\" of tokens to the address \"to\"\\n            transferToken(investors[i],investorTokens[i]);\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNotice that the loop in this contract runs over an array which can be artificially inflated. An attacker can create many user accounts making the `investor` array large.

Owner operations** - Another common pattern is where owners have specific privileges in contracts and must perform some task in order for the contract to proceed to the next state. One example would be an ICO contract that requires the owner to `finalize()` the contract which then allows tokens to be transferable, i.e.\\n``` solidity\\nbool public isFinalized = false;\\naddress public owner; // gets set somewhere\\n\\nfunction finalize() public {\\n    require(msg.sender == owner);\\n    isFinalized == true;\\n}\\n\\n// ... extra ICO functionality\\n\\n// overloaded transfer function\\nfunction transfer(address _to, uint _value) returns (bool) {\\n    require(isFinalized);\\n    super.transfer(_to,_value)\\n}\\n\\n...\\n\\n```\\nIn such cases, if a privileged user loses their private keys, or becomes inactive, the entire token contract becomes inoperable.

If you send ether to one of these addresses, it can be later recovered by calling the `retrieveHiddenEther()` enough times.

       "This attack can occur when a contract sends ether to an unknown address. An attacker can carefully construct a contract at an external address which contains malicious code in the [fallback function](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contracts.html?highlight=fallback#fallback-function). Thus, when a contract sends ether to this address, it will invoke the malicious code. Typically the malicious code executes a function on the vulnerable contract, performing operations not expected by the developer. The name \"re-entrancy\" comes from the fact that the external malicious contract calls back a function on the vulnerable contract and \"*re-enters*\" code execution at an arbitrary location on the vulnerable contract.\n",

To fix this vulnerability, the `withdrawReward` function should be updated to include a check to ensure that the recipient is not a contract. One way to do this is to use the `extcodesize` opcode to check if the recipient has bytecode. If the recipient has bytecode, then it is a contract and the function should revert. \n",

       "  The vulnerability in the code is that anyone can call `withdrawReward` function and steal the rewards of any user. To fix it, the `withdrawReward` function should only be callable by the contract owner or a specific authorized address. Also, the use of `call()` function in the `withdrawReward` function can be dangerous, because it can execute malicious code. Instead, use `transfer()` or `send()` functions to send ether to the recipient. \n",

       "  The vulnerability in this code is that the `withdrawReward()` function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks because it allows the recipient's fallback function to be called before the transfer is complete. This can be addressed by using the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, which means checking conditions first, then performing any necessary state changes, and finally interacting with other contracts. One way to implement this is to use a boolean variable to ensure that the `withdrawReward()` function can only be called once and to only perform the transfer after all state changes have been made. The fixed code is:\n",
